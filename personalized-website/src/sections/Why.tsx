            I thrive in collaborative environments and, above all, enjoy
            learning from smart and talented people. The opportunity to work
            where my opinions are valued and where I can contribute meaningfully
            is something I deeply desire for my next co-op. In my current co-op,
            I work daily with TypeScript and Next.js, and I thoroughly enjoy it.
            The prospect of deepening my expertise with React and other
            front-end systems excites me, and I believe this role offers an
            ideal opportunity to grow in this area.
