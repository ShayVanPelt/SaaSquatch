            As a fourth-year Software Engineering student at the University of
            Victoria, I bring a solid foundation in frontend development and
            practical experience using tools like React, Vue, and TypeScript. I
            have hands-on experience building intuitive user interfaces and
            solving real-world problems, including developing a Discord bot with
            SQLite integration and creating a data visualization project
            combining Python and JavaScript. My passion for building
            user-centered applications aligns seamlessly with impact.comâ€™s
            mission. Additionally, my ability to thrive in collaborative,
            fast-paced environments ensures I can contribute effectively to the
            team and continue to grow under your mentorship.
