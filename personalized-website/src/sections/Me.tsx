            As a fourth-year Software Engineering student at the University of
            Victoria, I bring solid front-end development experience to the
            table. I have used React in numerous school group projects and
            recently built a portfolio website using Next.js and TailwindCSS
            (shayvanpelt.com)â€”the same stack this site is built with!
            Admittedly, I reused some components between projects.

            Programming has been a passion of mine for over eight years, both in
            and outside of school, and I consistently strive for perfection in
            my work. I am highly detail-oriented and pride myself on my ability
            to collaborate effectively with teammates and co-workers.
            Additionally, I have experience with UX/UI tools like Figma, further
            enhancing my ability to create user-friendly, visually appealing
            designs. I am confident that I can make meaningful contributions to
            your team.
